# Classification on the iris dataset using the ID3 Decision Tree algorithm.
This repository contains the source code that implements the ID3 Decision Tree algorithm in the Julia programming language and the iris.csv file that contains data.

Because the attributes of the iris set all have continuous values, I discretize each attribute by choosing one of the attribute values as the cut-off threshold to divide the attribute values into two parts so that entropy is the smallest.

Just clone the repo and run the decision_tree_id3.jl file on your computer, as long as the decision_tree_id3.jl file and iris.csv file are always in the same directory.
